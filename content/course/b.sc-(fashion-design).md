aboutTitle: "About B.Des/B.Sc (Fashion Design)"
aboutDescription: "Communication through Graphics Design is indeed an art and a job that anybody with a creative mind may pursue. When referred to as an art form, it entails the preparation and projection of ideas and experiences via the use of images and verbal information. It makes no difference what it is used for, as the content might be digital or tangible. However, the wide definition of graphic design is a method of visual communication that tries to address issues via the use of text, space, image, and colour."
