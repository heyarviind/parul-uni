aboutTitle: "About BBA-MBA"
aboutDescription: "The BBA MBA dual degree programme is a five-year undergraduate plus postgraduate integrated study that a candidate can begin as soon as he or she completes his or her 10+2 examinations. It integrates both the undergraduate BBA and the postgraduate MBA degree programmes into a single integrated course. Bachelor of Business Administration is an abbreviation for Bachelor of Business Administration. Candidates can pursue it immediately after completing their 10+2. The distinct BBA programme lasts three years. An MBA or Master of Business Administration, on the other hand, may be pursued only after completing a 10+2+3 or 10+2+4 level academic programme. MBA programmes last two years. Candidates interested in pursuing an integrated BBA MBA must apply for both degrees just once because it is a dual degree programme."
