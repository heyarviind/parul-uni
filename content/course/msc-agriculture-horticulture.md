aboutTitle: "About  M.SC. (AGRICULTURE) HORTICULTURE"
aboutDescription: "Horticulture is an agronomic science that studies the cultivation of trees, vegetables, flowers, and landscape architecture. Horticulture is involved in the cultivation of plants for human food, as well as for medical purposes or merely for aesthetic pleasure. Horticulture is a combination of science and technology with ideas of art and design. Students are prepared to face one of our planet's most pressing challenges: producing enough food for an expanding population without putting an irreparable burden on the planet's scarce natural resources. With expertise and insight, agricultural scientists and students can help farmers grow better food types according to the climate, soil conditions, and water availability of a particular region. •	The students will learn how all aspects of agriculture work together and how producers, marketers, and scientists apply them. •	By applying critical thinking and problem-solving techniques to a variety of animal and plant production systems, students will be able to demonstrate their skills. •	Students will discover how employer characteristics and decision-making at various levels can enhance the success of an agricultural enterprise."
