aboutTitle: "About M.Sc Public Health"
aboutDescription: "The Master of Public Health is a two-year multidisciplinary postgraduate degree for studies in public health. The initiative is aimed to place a greater emphasis on public health services than on research and education. The programme is divided into four semesters and lasts two years. A master's degree in public health (M.P.H.) is a programme that teaches students how to maintain public health while also dealing with challenges linked to public health via various methods such as health awareness initiatives. Students will also learn how to eliminate the condition and the factors that cause it. Students who complete a postgraduate degree in public health are qualified to work on a national and worldwide level in areas related to public health and its importance."
