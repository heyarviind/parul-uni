aboutDescription: "A mechanical engineer's brain is involved in almost everything that has to do with motion, whether it's a machine or a building. A study in mechanical engineering therefore provides students with this fundamental understanding of movement and the power/energy involved, making it feasible.

Mechanical engineering is used in the design and control of systems and processes in manufacturing plants, automobiles, aircrafts, machine tools, air conditioning, refrigeration, boilers, power plants, fuel processing, new material creation, process design, and the manufacture of a wide range of products ranging from home appliances to medical devices."
