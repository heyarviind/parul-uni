aboutTitle: "About M.Sc.(Forensics Science) Forensic Chemistry"
aboutDescription: "The M.Sc. in Forensic Science is intended for graduate students as well as forensic professionals. The goal of the course is to instil in students both theoretical and practical knowledge of fundamental components of forensic science. The principles of forensic biology and chemistry, which underpin most of the laboratory work related with forensic investigations, are first taught to enrolled students. Following that, the retrieval and processing of various types of evidence collected at crime scenes, as well as the appraisal and presentation of that evidence in legal contexts, are addressed in depth. Students have access to a variety of sophisticated resources, including state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment. Students must complete a research project after completing the course in order to enhance research abilities in a variety of tasks, both academic and non-academic."
